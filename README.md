# Text-Classification
The purpose of this project is to train a classifier to classify a given text message into its correct category. 
It consists of 20000 messages taken from 20 newsgroups. NLTK is first used to build the rich feature set i.e vocabulary by cleaning the data. The Multinomal Naive Bayes classifier available in sklearn is used to find out the score, besides that, Naive Bayes has been implemented from scratch in order to train the model.
